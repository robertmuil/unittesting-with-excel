# unittesting-with-excel

Using Excel for UnitTests in Python

## Sweet-spot for usage of this technique

1. algorithm being tested is complicated enough that you can't easily write the unittests yourself
1. can be communicated and understod enough to implement but hard to communicate all nuances (corner cases etc) and thus easy to make mistakes
1. 'owner' of algorithm (those who know it best) are most comfortable with a tool like Excel
1. 'owner' of algorithm can tell you what the right answer is for any example, but they canâ€™t code
